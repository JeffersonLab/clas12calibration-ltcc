FADC Trigger configuration for LTCC
-----------------------------------

The trigger files are located in

$CLON_PARMS/trigger/LTCC

To run the LTCC calibration, use the random trigger.

DAQ can be accessed with vnc from clonsl2

daqvnc


DAQ configuration for random trigger
------------------------------------

Configuration: LTCC
Config filename: ltcc_calib_random.trg

The "Download" step is the one downloading the actual FADC configuration above

This will produce a file ltcc_calib_random.cnf which includes everything loaded in the trigger. It is also saved in the data.

The file loaded by ltcc_calib_random.trg is ltcc_calib.cnf which in turns loads:

- TS, TDC, FADC various....ltcc_calib_various.cnf
- masks to ignore EC.......ltcc_calib_masks.cnf
- thresholds...............ltcc_calib_thresholds.cnf

Masks are ignored in internal pulser mode.
Currently various is removed because it is in ltcc_calib_random.trg
